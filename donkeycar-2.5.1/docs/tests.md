# Tests

There is a limited test suite to ensure that the your changes to the code
don't break something unintended.

### Run all the tests
``` python -m unittest ```


### Organization
The test code is in `tests` foders in the same folder as the code. This is to
help keep the test code linked to the code its self. If you change the code,
change the tests. :)

> TODO: Skip tests that require specific hardware.
