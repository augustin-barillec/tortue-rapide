## Donkey Docs

The source of the documenation gets built in the folder `../site` and is
published to (http://wroscoe.github.io/donkey). Our docs use extended markdown
as implemented by MkDocs.

### Building the documentation

* install MkDocs `pip install mkdocs`
* `mkdocs serve` starts a local webserver at localhost:8000
* `mkdocs build` Builds a static site in `../site` directory
* config docs with (../mkdocs.yml)
